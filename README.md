# computorv1
A program that solves polynomial equations of the 2nd degree
# Usage
You need to enter the equation with the terms ordered starting from the lowest power up 'til the biggest, like this:

python3 ComputorV1 "5 * X^0 + 3 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0 + 0 * X^1"
OR
python3 ComputorV1 "5 * X^0 + 3 * X^1 + 3 * X^2 = 0"

The program first displays the equation reduced -if need be-,
then its degree,
then its discriminant's sign -if need be-
then the solution(s)  IF they exist

Note*
This program doesn't solve equations of a degree greater than 2.

Enjoy :)
